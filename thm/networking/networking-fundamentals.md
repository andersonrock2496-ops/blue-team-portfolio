# Networking Fundamentals

## 🎯 Objective
Understand core networking concepts with relevance to security operations.

## 📘 Topics Covered
- OSI model
- TCP/IP layers
- Common protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, FTP, SSH)
- Plaintext vs encrypted traffic

## 🔍 What I Did
Studied how data moves across networks and how protocols communicate between systems.

## 🧠 SOC / Blue Team Relevance
From a SOC perspective, networking knowledge helps to:
- Identify suspicious traffic patterns
- Investigate data exfiltration
- Detect command-and-control behavior

## 📌 Common SOC Alerts
- Unusual outbound connections
- Repeated failed connections
- Suspicious protocol usage

## 📌 Lessons Learned
- Understanding protocols is essential for traffic analysis
- Encrypted traffic changes detection strategies
- Network visibility is critical for security operations

## 🚀 Next Step
Advance to cryptography and encrypted traffic analysis.
