# Networking — TryHackMe

## 🎯 Purpose
Build foundational networking knowledge for security monitoring and incident detection.

## 🔍 Why Networking matters for SOC
SOC analysts analyze network traffic to:
- Detect malicious activity
- Investigate suspicious connections
- Understand attack paths
- Validate security alerts

Without networking knowledge, alerts become meaningless.

## 🧠 Skills Practiced
- OSI model
- TCP/IP fundamentals
- Common protocols
- Network behavior analysis

## 🛠 Tools
- Packet analysis concepts
- Network command-line utilities

## 📌 Blue Team Perspective
Networking knowledge allows analysts to:
- Understand alerts at the packet and protocol level
- Detect anomalies in traffic patterns
- Investigate command-and-control activity

## 🚀 Next Steps
Apply networking concepts to:
- Traffic analysis labs
- IDS/IPS detection
- SIEM-based network alerts
